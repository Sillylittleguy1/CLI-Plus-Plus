CLI-Plus-Plus is a c++ based command line interface that allows for a "2.5dui" (dimensional-user-interface). Not quite a desktop. not quite a terminal.
Made for situations where a gui may be uneeded, undesireable, or too resource-heavy.
Can be compiled for ANY system. linux, windows, ARM, x32, x64. (Thank you cpp-terminal)
Bare bones, with only a default profile for necesities like file manager, terminal, and sys settings.
